Amazon Shopping Assistant CLI

Welcome to the Amazon Shopping Assistant CLI, a command-line interface that simulates an Amazon shopping experience. This assistant allows users to search for products, manage a shopping cart, check out, and inquire about orders using natural language. The assistant leverages an LLM (Language Model) to interpret user inputs and provides responses accordingly.
